The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) is a widely recognized methodology for developing, governing, and maintaining enterprise architecture. It enables organizations to align their information technology capabilities with strategic business goals by offering a structured approach to architecture development, governance, and implementation. TOGAF provides consistency, traceability, and reusability of architectural assets across the enterprise and throughout the lifecycle of systems and solutions.

## Structure

TOGAF comprises five core structural elements, each playing a specific role in supporting enterprise architecture activities. These components ensure that architecture is methodically developed, content is standardized, organizational capacity is in place, assets are reused, and reference models provide a starting point for design.

* **Architecture Development Method (ADM)**: A structured and iterative methodology that guides the creation, evolution, and governance of enterprise architecture across its various domains
* **Architecture Content Framework**: A standardized structure that defines the outputs of architecture work, including deliverables, artifacts, and reusable building blocks
* **Architecture Capability Framework**: A set of organizational guidelines for establishing and operating an enterprise architecture function, including roles, processes, and governance mechanisms
* **Enterprise Continuum and Tools**: A classification system and associated tools that support the contextualization, reuse, and evolution of architectural assets from general reference models to specific solutions
* **Reference Models**: Predefined architectural templates and models that provide common structures and services to accelerate and standardize architecture development

## Elements

### Architecture Development Method (ADM)

The Architecture Development Method (ADM) is the core process within TOGAF that defines how to develop and manage enterprise architecture. It is structured into a series of iterative phases that guide the architecture team through the entire lifecycle, from establishing the architecture vision to ensuring continuous improvement and change management.

The ADM includes the following phases:

* **Preliminary Phase** prepares the organization by establishing architecture principles, governance structures, and a capability for architecture work
* **Phase A: Architecture Vision** defines the high-level vision and objectives for the architecture engagement and secures stakeholder buy-in
* **Phase B: Business Architecture** models business processes, functions, capabilities, and organizational structures that support the strategic objectives
* **Phase C: Information Systems Architecture** is divided into:
  * **Data Architecture**, which defines the logical and physical data assets and data management practices
  * **Application Architecture**, which outlines the software applications, their interactions, and alignment with business functions
* **Phase D: Technology Architecture** details the hardware, software, and network infrastructure needed to support the business and application systems
* **Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions** identifies possible implementation approaches and transition architectures
* **Phase F: Migration Planning** creates a roadmap of prioritized projects aligned with organizational readiness and dependencies
* **Phase G: Implementation Governance** ensures that implementation projects remain aligned with the architectural vision and principles
* **Phase H: Architecture Change Management** establishes mechanisms for monitoring and evolving the architecture in response to change
* **Requirements Management** is a continuous phase that ensures all requirements are identified, addressed, and maintained throughout the ADM cycle

### Architecture Content Framework

The Architecture Content Framework provides a standardized model for organizing the outputs created throughout the ADM process. Its goal is to ensure consistency in architecture documentation and to facilitate stakeholder understanding, governance, and reuse.

The framework defines three key categories:

* **Deliverables** are formal outputs such as the Architecture Definition Document, Architecture Roadmap, or Statement of Architecture Work
* **Artifacts** include visualizations and documentation such as catalogs, matrices, and diagrams representing views of architectural elements
* **Building Blocks** are reusable components that can be either:
  * **Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs)**: Logical elements used during design
  * **Solution Building Blocks (SBBs)**: Physical elements such as software applications or technology platforms

### Architecture Capability Framework

The Architecture Capability Framework defines the organizational structures and capabilities required to carry out architecture work effectively. It provides guidance on how to institutionalize architecture within the enterprise, ensuring that architecture activities are repeatable, governed, and strategically aligned.

Key components include:

* **Architecture Organization Structure**
* **Architecture Governance**
* **Skills Framework**
* **Maturity Models**

These ensure that architecture functions are integrated into enterprise operations and can continuously improve.

### Enterprise Continuum and Tools

The Enterprise Continuum is a conceptual model used to classify and organize architectural assets based on their level of abstraction and specificity. It supports the reuse and evolution of architectural knowledge across projects and programs.

It includes:

* **Architecture Continuum**: Ranging from Foundation Architectures to Organization-Specific Architectures
* **Solutions Continuum**: Mapping abstract architectures to concrete implementations, such as off-the-shelf or bespoke systems

Tools and repositories aligned with the continuum enable architects to manage assets, support compliance, and accelerate design efforts.

### Reference Models

TOGAF provides reference models that serve as standardized architectural templates for foundational services and integration. These models promote interoperability and design completeness.

Key examples include:

**Technical Reference Model (TRM)**: Defines core platform services and their interfaces

**Integrated Information Infrastructure Reference Model (III-RM)**: Focuses on service-based integration and information sharing across organizational boundaries

{{< image-external src="../../../../../images/competencies/modeling/frameworks/togaf.model.iiirm.png" alt="TOGAF Reference Model" href="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/togaf/togaf-91-framework/#togaf-reference-model" msg="Source: https://www.visual-paradigm.com" size="medium" >}}

These are particularly useful for ensuring architectural consistency and leveraging best practices.

## Dimensions

Beyond its structural elements, TOGAF defines several key *classification dimensions* that help scope, contextualize, and align architecture activities. These dimensions provide practical ways to frame *what* is being architected, *where* within the enterprise architecture is applied, and *when* architecture changes are expected to occur. The primary dimensions are:

### Architecture Domains

Architecture domains represent the primary subject areas of enterprise architecture. These domains ensure comprehensive coverage by dividing the enterprise landscape into logically distinct but interrelated layers. They are used extensively in ADM Phases B–D and define the scope of models and artifacts in the Architecture Content Framework.

* **Business Architecture**: Describes the business strategy, governance, organization, and key business processes
* **Data Architecture**: Defines the structure of data entities, their relationships, and governance policies
* **Application Architecture**: Describes software systems, their interactions, and their alignment with business functions
* **Technology Architecture**: Covers hardware, networks, middleware, and platforms needed to support the applications and data

These domains support the separation of concerns and traceability across architectural views.

### Architecture Partitioning

Architecture Partitioning addresses the complexity of large organizations by breaking down the enterprise architecture landscape into manageable and governable units. It enables organizations to effectively assign ownership, reuse artifacts, and scale architecture practices.

* **Enterprise Architecture**: Covers the entire organization and provides a strategic, high-level view
* **Segment Architecture**: Focuses on a specific business unit, geography, or function (e.g., HR or Logistics)
* **Capability Architecture**: Designed for a specific initiative or solution, such as a cloud migration or product launch

Partitioning facilitates concurrent development, team autonomy, and layered governance.

### Architecture States (Time Horizons)

TOGAF recognizes the need to represent the evolution of architecture over time. This is done through *architecture states*, which describe the condition of the architecture at different points in the transformation journey. These are crucial for planning, sequencing, and governing enterprise change.

* **Baseline Architecture**: The current “as-is” state of architecture
* **Target Architecture**: The future “to-be” state aligned with business goals
* **Transition Architectures**: Intermediate states that support stepwise migration and phased delivery

These time horizons are critical for roadmap development, risk management, and execution planning.

## Conclusion

TOGAF offers a comprehensive and adaptable framework for enterprise architecture that integrates method, structure, governance, and reuse. Its five structural elements—ADM, content and capability frameworks, enterprise continuum, and reference models—form the operational core. Complementing these are its classification dimensions: domains for architectural coverage, partitioning for governance scope, and time horizons for transformation planning. Together, these components and dimensions enable organizations to manage complexity, align IT with business strategy, and deliver sustainable architectural value.
