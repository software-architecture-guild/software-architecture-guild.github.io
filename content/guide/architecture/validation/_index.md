title: "Validation"
description: "This section shows how to validate your architecture instead of just hoping it works. You’ll learn how to link architecture to implementation and tests, define and track meaningful metrics, measure system qualities in production, and reconstruct real structure from existing code. From structured evaluation and risk analysis to economic trade-offs and lightweight governance, you get a complete toolkit for checking if your architecture is fit for purpose, staying ahead of drift, and making better long-term decisions."
