The C4 model is a hierarchical framework designed for visualizing the
architecture of software systems. It emphasizes clarity and simplicity, making
it accessible for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. The framework
consists of a set of diagram types that represent different levels of
abstraction, enabling users to convey the architecture of a system effectively.
It is tool-agnostic, allowing various tools to be employed for creating the
diagrams.

One of the significant benefits of the C4 model is its "zoom-in" approach,
allowing stakeholders to navigate from high-level diagrams to more detailed
ones. For example, an element depicted in the context diagram can be further
elaborated in a container diagram, and each container can be broken down into
its components in subsequent diagrams. This hierarchical representation not only
facilitates a deeper understanding of each element but also ensures that each
diagram serves a specific purpose while contributing to the overall narrative of
the system architecture.

## Diagram Types

- Context Diagram: Provides a high-level overview of the system and its
  interactions with external entities. This diagram sets the stage for
  understanding how the system fits into its broader environment.
- Container Diagram: Breaks down the system into its major containers,
  illustrating relationships between them. This level of detail allows
  stakeholders to see how different parts of the system interact.
- Component Diagram: Offers a detailed view of the components within a specific
  container and their interactions. This helps in understanding the internal
  structure of the container and how components collaborate to fulfill system
  requirements.
- Code Diagram: Focuses on the implementation level, typically showing classes
  or modules within a component. This diagram is particularly useful for
  developers to grasp the details of the code structure.

## Static vs. Dynamic Diagrams

In addition to the various diagram types, itâ€™s essential to understand the
distinction between static and dynamic diagrams. Static diagrams illustrate the
structure of a system at a specific point in time, detailing its components and
their relationships. Dynamic diagrams, on the other hand, depict how the system
behaves over time, showcasing interactions and processes as they occur. This
differentiation helps stakeholders appreciate both the architectural layout and
the functional behavior of the system.
