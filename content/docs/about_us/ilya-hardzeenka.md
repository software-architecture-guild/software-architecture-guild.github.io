### My Educational Journey

##### Beginning

My journey into technology began at the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics, where I earned a **Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications Engineering** (2007–2012). This education provided me with a strong foundation in telecommunications and programming, including coding in **C++** with elements of Assembler, and developing low-level telecommunication processing algorithms. Building on this, I pursued a **Master's in Information Technology** (2012–2014), where I expanded my expertise in advanced software systems and data management. These formative years set the stage for my career in technology.

My education didn’t end with formal degrees—it became a continuous process. On the job, I learn something new every day, and I make it a point to **read 2–3 professional books each year** to stay at the forefront of technological advancements.

##### Transitioning to Data Engineering

I began my career learning *Java* but quickly shifted focus to **data engineering**. Early on, I mastered **IBM technologies** such as *DB2*, *Datastage*, *Cognos*, and *Message Broker*. At the same time, I delved into **data architecture**, studying *Kimball’s Data Warehousing* theory and *dimensional modeling* to gain a deeper understanding of designing data systems.

##### Embracing Big Data

The advent of the **Big Data** era brought new challenges and opportunities. I immersed myself in the **Hadoop ecosystem**, learning tools and platforms like *HDFS*, *Spark*, *Hive*, *Oozie*, and *Cloudera and Hortonworks* distributions. This era also introduced new architectural paradigms, such as **Data Lakes** and **Lambda/Kappa architectures**, which I embraced while transitioning into leadership and architectural roles. I developed "hard" architecture skills by adopting frameworks like the **Viewpoints and Perspectives** Framework and mastering **C4 diagrams** for architectural design.

##### Adapting to the Cloud Revolution

As **cloud computing** gained prominence, I returned to IBM in a role as **Technical Delivery Leader**, which required significant learning and adaptation. I dove into **cloud-native** technologies, including *Docker* and *Kubernetes*, to run Big Data workloads, and learned how to build *CI/CD* pipelines with *GitLab* and *IBM Toolchains*. I also gained expertise in deploying and maintaining *ElasticSearch* and *Kafka* clusters, managing *cloud storage*, and setting up *logging* and *monitoring* solutions.

From an architectural perspective, I expanded my expertise to **solutions architecture**, enabling me to design *web-based* applications, *data management* systems, and the *infrastructure* to support them. I also explored *DevOps* practices, *microservices*, and *machine learning* system integration into data pipelines and services. Additionally, I deepened my knowledge of *data governance*, *DataOps*, and *data quality* frameworks.

##### Growing Leadership and Management Skills

In this phase, I began **leading a team** of 8, which grew to 24 members under my leadership. I honed my **management skills**, implementing *Agile practices* (Scrum) and developing effective *planning* and *estimation* methods for team projects. **Mentorship** became a significant focus, as I worked closely with team members to support their professional growth. My role also required frequent *communication* with technical leads and managers, which sharpened my *collaboration* and *presentation* skills.

##### Advancing to a Product Company

I transitioned to a product company as a **Solution Architect** and was quickly promoted to **Lead (Chief) Architect**. This role pushed me to learn extensively about *business operations* and *product development*. I was tasked with *mentoring* individuals into becoming architects, further enhancing my management and mentorship skills. Responsibilities like **resource management**, *salary reviews*, *feedback cycles*, and *one-on-one* meetings became integral parts of my work.

During this period, I matured as an **architect and leader**, working closely with C-level executives and vice presidents. I refined my *communication* and *presentation* skills and learned to craft **strategy and technical vision** aligned with *business objectives*. Additionally, I gained insights into **engineering organizational structures**, supported by frameworks such as *Team Topologies*.
