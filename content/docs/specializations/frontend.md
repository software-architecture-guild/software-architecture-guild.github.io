## Front-End Architecture overview
Front-end architecture is an important part of user-facing application development. It involves the choice of structure, components, and technologies used to build the user interface. Understanding the different types of front-end applications and their architectural patterns is essential to creating efficient, scalable, and maintainable applications.

### Types of Front-End Applications

Front-end applications can be broadly categorized into three types:
* **Web Applications** \
   These applications run in a web browser and are accessed via URLs. They range from static websites to more dynamic, interactive web apps.
  * MPA is a traditional web application model where each interaction or user request results in the loading of a new HTML page from the server.
  * SPA is a type of Web application that loads a single HTML document and then dynamically updates the page to provide a smooth, application-like user experience.
  * PWA is a Web application that mimics the functionality of native mobile apps (can work offline, send push notifications, etc.), but is built using common web technologies and works on any platform with a PWA-compatible browser.

* **Desktop Applications** \
  These applications run directly on a user's desktop or laptop. They offer a more native-like experience and can access local resources.

* **Mobile Applications** \
  These applications are designed to run on mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. They can be native apps built using platform-specific frameworks or hybrid apps that combine web technologies with native components.

#### Books
* Luca Mezzalira, [Building Micro-frontend](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-micro-frontends/9781492082989/)
  * What's the answer to today's increasingly complex web applications? Micro-frontends. Inspired by the microservices model, this approach lets you break interfaces into separate features managed by different teams of developers. With this practical guide, Luca Mezzalira shows software architects, tech leads, and software developers how to build and deliver artifacts atomically rather than use a big bang deployment.
  You'll learn how micro-frontends enable your team to choose any library or framework. This gives your organization technical flexibility and allows you to hire and retain a broad spectrum of talent. Micro-frontends also support distributed or colocated teams more efficiently. Pick up this book and learn how to get started with this technological breakthrough right away.
