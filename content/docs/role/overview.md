### Core Responsibilities

The core responsibilities of a software architect extend far beyond merely designing software systems. These responsibilities encompass stakeholder management, creating architectural blueprints, ensuring the implementation aligns with the architecture, and addressing quality attributes. Chapter 5 of *Software Systems Architecture* details these core responsibilities, which define the role of the software architect as a central figure in bridging the gap between business needs and technical execution. Let’s explore each responsibility in more depth.

##### **1. Identifying and Engaging Stakeholders**

Stakeholders are individuals or groups vested in the system, including business leaders, end-users, developers, security teams, and IT operations. A software architect must:

* **Identify All Relevant Stakeholders**: Architects are responsible for identifying all key stakeholders, ensuring that everyone affected by or contributing to the system is considered. This identification process involves mapping out who will interact with or depend on the system. Missing key stakeholders early on can lead to critical issues later in the project, such as unmet requirements or unexpected constraints.
* **Engage Stakeholders Effectively**: Engaging stakeholders involves facilitating discussions, workshops, and meetings to capture their concerns and expectations. Architects use various tools, such as interviews, surveys, and requirements-gathering sessions, to build a comprehensive picture of what the system needs to achieve. This engagement must continue throughout the project lifecycle as stakeholder expectations often evolve.
* **Manage Stakeholder Expectations and Conflicts**: Different stakeholders often have competing interests and conflicting requirements. For instance, business executives may prioritize time-to-market and functionality, while developers and IT staff may emphasize maintainability and security. Architects need strong negotiation and communication skills to balance these conflicts, ensuring the system meets the organization’s strategic goals without neglecting critical technical and operational considerations.

##### **2. Understanding and Capturing Stakeholder Concerns**

Stakeholder concerns are the driving force behind all architectural decisions. These concerns can include functional requirements (like specific features) and non-functional requirements (like performance, security, and scalability). Effective management of these concerns is crucial to delivering a system that meets stakeholder needs. A software architect must:

* **Capture and Document Requirements**: Architects must gather and document requirements from stakeholders in a structured and comprehensive manner. This includes distinguishing between functional and non-functional requirements and understanding the underlying motivations for each requirement. Stakeholder concerns should be mapped to specific quality attributes, such as performance, resilience, or usability.
